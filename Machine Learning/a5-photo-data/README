- test directory contains the test images. These are rotated in random
  directions and the test-labels.txt file contains the correct
  orientation label.

- train directory contains the train images. These are all at 0
  degrees orientation; the make-train-data.sh script rotates them
  explicitly to generate training data.

- You can run the scripts like this:

make-test-data.sh test-labels.txt > test-data.txt
make-train-data.sh train-labels.txt > train-data.txt
